1️⃣ Comparator in Java

A Comparator in Java is used to define custom sorting logic for objects. It is a functional interface in java.util package and contains a single method:

int compare(T o1, T o2);

It is used when:

    Sorting objects based on multiple fields.
    Sorting in descending order.
    Custom sorting requirements.

Example: Sorting Employees by Salary and Name

import java.util.*;

class Employee {
    String name;
    double salary;

    Employee(String name, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + " - $" + salary;
    }
}

public class ComparatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(
                new Employee("Rahul", 50000),
                new Employee("Ravi", 70000),
                new Employee("Amit", 60000)
        );

        // Sorting by Salary (Ascending)
        employees.sort(Comparator.comparingDouble(emp -> emp.salary));

        System.out.println("Sorted by Salary (Ascending): " + employees);

        // Sorting by Name (Alphabetical)
        employees.sort(Comparator.comparing(emp -> emp.name));

        System.out.println("Sorted by Name (Alphabetical): " + employees);

        // Sorting by Salary (Descending)
        employees.sort(Comparator.comparingDouble(emp -> emp.salary).reversed());

        System.out.println("Sorted by Salary (Descending): " + employees);
    }
}
